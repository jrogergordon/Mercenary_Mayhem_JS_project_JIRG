Intro:
Hello Dear Reader! Thank you for looking at my dear old game. For the King
is a grid based strategy game, that plays a little bit like tag. You, the player,
are in control of two pieces: the King and the King's protector Boyd, both
loacted in the upper right of the map. Petrine, the enemy, is located in the bottom
right and she will seek out the King. Petrine moves 4 spaces on each turn while
the King and Boyd can move 6 on each turn.
If Petrine touches the King she will slay him and you will lose! But if Boyd hits
Petrine twice he will kill her and you will win! Good luck!
